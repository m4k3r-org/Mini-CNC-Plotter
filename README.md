# Mini-CNC-Plotter

A GUI application designed in Processing for the Mini CNC Plotter I made with salvaged stepper motors and drives from old CD drives. It's currently under development. I'll upload all the documentation once I finish the hardware and software for it.

This is what I'm using for developeing the control software : www.processing.org

My project website is at www.vishnumaiea.in

This project will be available at : http://www.vishnumaiea.in/projects/hardware/mini-cnc-plotter

# Mini-CNC-Plotter

A GUI application designed in Processing for the Mini CNC Plotter I made with salvaged stepper motors and drives from old CD drives. It's currently under development. I'll upload all the documentation once I finish the hardware and software for it.

This is what I'm using for developeing the control software : www.processing.org

I'll upload each version of the code here as I'm developing it and will organize them in a better manner once I finish it and make it ready for public release.

My project website is at www.vishnumaiea.in
